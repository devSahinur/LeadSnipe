# Privacy Policy for LeadSnipe

**Last Updated:** February 2, 2026

## Overview

LeadSnipe ("the Extension") is a browser extension that extracts email addresses from web pages. This privacy policy explains how we handle user data.

## Data Collection

**LeadSnipe does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

### What the Extension Does:
- Scans the current webpage for email addresses when you click "Extract Emails"
- Displays found emails in the extension popup
- Allows you to copy emails to clipboard or export to CSV/TXT files

### What the Extension Does NOT Do:
- ❌ Collect personal information
- ❌ Track your browsing history
- ❌ Send data to external servers
- ❌ Store any data beyond your current session
- ❌ Use cookies or tracking technologies
- ❌ Share data with third parties

## Data Processing

All email extraction happens **locally in your browser**. The extension:

1. Reads the text content of the current webpage
2. Uses pattern matching to find email addresses
3. Displays results in the popup
4. Everything stays on your device

**No data ever leaves your browser.**

## Permissions Explained

These permissions are only used when you actively click the extension icon.
